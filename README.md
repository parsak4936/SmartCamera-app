# SmartCamera-app
The smart camera recognizes the defined members
with artificial intelligence algorithms of facial recognition and
automatically opens the door for them.
This project is the last undergraduate project implemented with react
native, which controls the management actions of the camera, such as
opening the door remotely, adding or removing members, changing the
entry status of members, monitoring the history of the defined door
opening. .
This identification is done even with a mask or new scar on face.
The advantage of this project is its low-cost and accessible hardware.
The team that created this camera is the startup team of EpIran. During the construction of this project, I
was responsible for developing the application, presenting and designing its advertisement assets
